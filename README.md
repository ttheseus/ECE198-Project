# ECE198-Project
STM32 Nucleo Board project done for the ECE198 course at Waterloo.

[Project]
  Baby monitor - includes PIR motion sensor, digital temperature sensor, 2 STM32F401RE Nucleo Boards
  Jira Board Link: https://uwaterloo-team-i4eng65q.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/EC/board
  Project Proposal:
  Design Document:

[Implementation Demo]
  Demo Agenda: 
    Heading
      - section number
      - Group number
      - Date of Implementation Demo
      - Name of grading TA
      - One line description of project
    Design process review:
      List up to 6 design revisions to be reviewed by the graidng TA. Examples:
        - System archetecture drawing
        - Electrical schematic
        - Git merges
    Test Demonstrations
      - One line description of the test
      - One line description of key test inputs/parameters
      - Specification of the pass/fail threshold including measurement standard

  Design process review:
    Design changes [30 points] = each significant change is [5 points]
      - Electrical schematic changes
          - Schematic must be drawn in software
          - Revision # must be clearly marked
          - Date of revision must be clearly marked
          - Description of changes compared to previous version are clearly documented
      - Git merge
          - Must be a merge to the main branch. Main branch must be protected. Code is not   
          being committed regularly to the main branch but to sub branches that are then merged 
          in through merge requests
          - Merge is for significant feature of implementation (bugs DO NOT count as feature 
          implementations)
          - Merge/commit messages must CLEARLY EXPLAIN HOW FEATURE WAS IMPLEMENTED. What new 
          functions/methods were implemented
      - Workspace file folder snapshot
          - Single file folder contains snapshot of the entire codebase
          - File folder name states the revision # as well as the date of the snapshot taken
          - Text file at the top level of the folder describing the files that were changes 
          since the last revision and an explanation of those changes (changes.txt)
      - System architecture diagrams
          - Drawings must be drawn in software
          - Revision # must be clearly marked
          - Date of revision muct be clearly marked
          - Description of changes compared to previous version are clearly documented
      - Mechanical drawings
          - Drawings must be drawn in software
          - Revision # must be clearly marked
          - Date of revision muct be clearly marked
          - Description of changes compared to previous version are clearly documented

  Test Demonstrations:
    Test runs [30 points] - 3 tests out of 5 specified in design doc must be done once. Each test is graded out of [10 points].
      - [2 points] - Test setup matches Design Document Specification
      - [2 points] - Environmental parameters match Design Document specification.
      - [2 points] - Test inputs match Design Document specification
      - [2 points] - Measurement standard matches Design Document Specification
      - [2 points] - System passes the test
